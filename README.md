# Quick Notes

## Problem

Q1: The LPR task is a downstream task of the project, the input image could be a imcomplete license plate, therefore the output should think about the situation that the license plate is not complete.

Q2: The license plate in South Korea includes Korean letters and numbers, so the model should be able to recognize both.
